Peer-graded Assignment for Getting and Cleaning Data Course 

The current repo is made by Pengfei LI, which is a submission for Getting and Cleaning Data Couse on Cousera. The aim for this assignment is to analyze the dataset of Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphone("http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones")

Dataset is offered by the link on Cousera.

The introductions of files in the repo are:
1. codebook.md  a code book that shows all the variables, data, and the procedure about how I clean the data;

2. run_analysis.R  a file which presents the detailed process of data cleaning. In this file, I follow the instruction on Cousera(5-step instruction). The 5-step instruction is pasted below:

        1).Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
        2).Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
        3).Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
        4).Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
        5).From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the               average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
3. fina_data.txt  a file which contains the exported data after cleaning.
